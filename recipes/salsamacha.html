    <p>Take into account that <strong>the name of this sauce is not accidental</strong>. It is called like that 
        because it is very spicy, suitable only for people who have a hard time with chili. 
        Nothing like some tacos de suadero with onion and coriander, or with seasoned mushrooms, 
        with a few drops of this incendiary beauty that can last for months in the refrigerator.</p>
    <p>Many of us love machas sauces, but we don't know how to make them. Say no more and let's 
        get to work. In addition, the recipe that we share with you today is special because <strong> 
        comes direct from Orizaba, Veracruz</strong>. Normally it is not so common for this type of sauce 
        to be made with serrano pepper, but in that region of the country it is. Once you try it, 
        you will discover how rich it is. </p>
    <p>This simple recipe can be made with the basic utensils of any kitchen, you will only need 
        to use a frying pan and a blender, although if you want to make it in a traditional way, 
        a good stone molcajete is the basic kitchen utensil for sauces.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>T-Fal nonstick pans set of two</li>
        <li>Hamilton Beach Blender</li>
        <li>Granite molcajete</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Let's get started!</strong></p>

    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <p><em>For 15 people</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil .............................................. 300ml</li>
        <li>Serrano chile dry and without tails .....200g</li>
        <li>one teaspoon of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p> <p><strong>Total time:</strong> 15 minutes </p> <p><strong>Cook in</strong> 15 minutes</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a frying pan add all the oil and heat over low heat.</li>
        <li>Fry the chiles there until they are golden brown, not burned.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and remove some of the oil. In case you need to, make yourself 
            some eggs or a meat stir fry with that oil is a great idea. It will give your food a 
            lot of flavor.</li>
        <li>Let the chilies cool with the oil.</li>
        <li>Then blend the chiles with the salt until they are ground, but with flakes. Then 
            transfer them to a glass jar with a tight lid. Remember to always stir the content 
            before serving.</li>
        <li>Now, if you use a molcajete, first grind the chilies with the salt and gradually add 
            a drizzle of oil. Once the sauce has the term you want, put it in a jar as well and 
            shake it well before storing. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Ready: your macha sauce is very ready for you to enjoy in any stew. But of course! 
        take it light because it has a good level of itching.</p>
